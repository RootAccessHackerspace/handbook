# Classes and Workshops

A variety of educational and skill development activity options are available. Our goal is to provide a positive experience in learning and developing your skills in making. Details will be posted and signup available online. Non-members can enroll in most classes. If you have any questions about a class, please contact Root Access. You will need to have signed a liability waiver prior to participation in the class/workshop. Make sure you are committed to the full timeframe and to following the instructor's direction, as there are no refunds. Some classes may require preparation, so make sure you check and ensure you are ready with everything needed.

**Please arrive at least 15 minutes before the scheduled timeframe** so you can check in and have everything ready the moment it starts. Late arrivals may not be accepted.

For safety, you must remain with the instructor and follow their instruction for the duration. Unsafe behavior will endanger membership status and/or ability to return to the makerspace.

If you have an idea for a class or workshop, please contact us to help you develop your idea.


## ROOT Classes

In order to use certain tools and equipment, members must attend the machine's ROOT class (Rudimentary Operation Of Tools) and/or pass all relevant testing requirements. Upon completion, members will be able to use the machine at will.

You are always responsible to use tools in a safe manner. Root Access leadership may, at their sole discretion, revoke your ability to use and reserve certain equipment effective immediately. Root Access may, at its sole discretion, require you to successfully complete a training class again before using some equipment. We may take this action to ensure the safety of people and equipment, or for any other reason we deem appropriate. If you feel you have been denied access to equipment unfairly, you may appeal the decision to the Executive Director, who has final authority on all matters.

Materials used in a ROOT class are always provided, and any specific preparation such as additional attire restrictions will be outlined in the ROOT class requirements. There may be suggested reading or videos to help you make the most of the class before you arrive.

ROOT classes are offered on a regular basis for all equipment requiring clearance, including:

* 3D printers
* Laser cutter
* Sergers
* Sewing machines

## Skills Classes

These are development courses for specific tools and typically involve learning a new skill while creating something. They are typically a single session, and you may or may not need to bring your own materials. Please refer to the description for the specific class.

Examples of skills workshops include electronic through-hole soldering, knitting, and quilting.

## Workshops

Workshops are guided project builds, and you will generally walk away with something you made. They can run as a one session event or through multiple sessions for more involved projects. You may or may not need to bring your own materials or additional tools. Please refer to the details in the Workshop requirements. Please refer to the description for the specific workshop.
