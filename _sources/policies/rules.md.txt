# General Rules

## 0. Don't be the reason for making a new rule.

Follow the rules and safety guidelines we have, use common sense, and don't be the reason we have to make a new rule. _Assume that every other rule on this list has an implicit "See also: Rule 0." appended to it._

## 1. Be excellent to each other.

The "Don't be a jerk" rule. For more information, including expected behavior, anti-harrassment policy, and details on reporting conduct violations, see the {doc}`/policies/conduct`.

## 2. Don't do anything illegal.

Root Access does not condone any illegal activities. Don't break the law in the space, using the space's equipment, or with something you built at the space. We are a space for learning and making, not for [black hats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hat_(computer_security)) or illegal computer hacking.

## 3. Safety rules are written in blood. Avoid blood.

Follow our {doc}`/safety/guidelines` and {doc}`/safety/tools` at all times, and encourage others to do the same. Additionally, for everyone's safety, firearms and ammunition of any kind, as well as materials of a dangerous, flammable, or explosive character that might unreasonably increase the danger of a fire or explosion, are strictly prohibited at the hackerspace.

## 4. Tools are for members.

Some tools at Root Access are dangerous, expensive, fragile, or some combination thereof. As such, only members may generally use the tools and equipment at the hackerspace. Allowing a guest or non-member to use equipment without the express permission of Root Access leadership is forbidden.

Members must also make every effort to ensure tools are not damaged in their use. They also understand that if they break something they may be responsible for the cost of replacement or repair.

## 5. Members must pay their dues.

Root Access exists because of memberships; if members don't pay their dues, we don't exist. Membership dues are expected to be paid in full, on time, each month. If you're having trouble or need an extension, let us know and we can work something out.

---

Singular, repeated, or flagrant violations of these rules may result in consequences including fines, temporary suspension of membersip, or permanent expulsion from the hackerspace, depending on the severity of the violation and at the discression of Root Access leadership. Any member who is suspended or expelled for rules violations will not receive a refund for unused membership time. Any person expelled from a class for rules violations will not receive a refund on class fees.
