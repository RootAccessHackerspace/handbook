# Video/Photo Policy

Please ask before taking photos or video of either a member or their work. You can take photos and video of projects that are intentionally on display.

It's fine to ask other members what they're working on, but please realize that sometimes the project may be sensitive and they may not be able to discuss it.

Root Access reserves the right to take photos of members and projects for promotional purposes, however, in accordance with the above guidelines, members may opt-out of photography of themselves and/or their projects.

## Video Surveillance 

For the safety of our members, guests, and equipment we have video cameras located inside and outside our facility. Security camera footage may be archived for several weeks or longer. In the event of theft, damage to the premises or equipment, violence, or for any other reason, we may review these recordings.
