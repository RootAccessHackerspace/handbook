# Class Policy

ROOT classes are intended to provide basic instruction on a specific tool or machine at Root Access so that people may safely and efficiently operate them. Some equipment – especially that which is potentially dangerous or expensive – require the completion of a ROOT class before it can be used.

Skill classes and project workshops are generally project-based, offer more hands-on working time, and result in a finished product. As their names suggest, skills classes are generally aimed at learning a new skill or improving an existing one, and project workshops are about creating something to take home.

Neither our classes nor workshops are associated with any professional or industry-level certification status, nor is any document issued upon completion.

Non-members may take any class at Root Access, and are limited to using only the tools required for the duration of the class. Members generally pay discounted class fees and are able to use our tools and equipment any time during our standard operating hours.

## Experienced Users

If you have prior experience with a tool or machine that requires a ROOT class, you may be eligible to test out of having to take that class. For more information, please get in touch.

## Conduct Policy

All students are expected to abide by our [Code of Conduct](./conduct/). Students who exhibit gross or repeated unsafe or disruptive behavior may be removed from the class, and no refund or class credit will be given.

## Refund Policy

Full refunds or a class credit can be provided if you cancel at least 48-hours in advance. There are no refunds or class credits available if you do not contact us at least 48-hours before the start of the class.

## Missed Classes Policy

There are no refunds, transfers, make-ups or deferments for missed classes. Please contact us before the start of the class if you believe you are going to be late or miss the class entirely.

## Cancellation Policy

Root Access reserves the right to cancel any class for any reason. Anyone enrolled in a class which is canceled will be notified by phone or email, if a valid phone number or email address has been provided. Anyone enrolled in a canceled class will be offered a full refund or class credit for the class.
