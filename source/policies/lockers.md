# Locker Policy

Root Access offers lockers for rent to active members for storing tools, materials, and works-in-progress. Lockers can be rented through the [locker portal](https://rootaccess.org/account/lockers/) in your account dashboard. By renting a locker, you agree to follow the rules below:

## General Rules

**Labeling Required:** All lockers must be clearly labeled with your name, nickname, or other visible identifier. You can print a label or use tape and marker — just make sure it's legible.

**No Hazardous or Illegal Items:** Lockers may not be used to store flammable, explosive, perishable, or illegal materials. Locker contents are subject to inspection if there is a safety or security concern. For more information, see the {doc}`/policies/rules` and {doc}`/safety/guidelines`.

**Bring Your Own Lock (Optional):** You're welcome to bring your own padlock or combination lock, use a magnet or twist tie, or even leave it unlocked. If you choose not to use a lock, that's fine — just be aware that anyone may open your locker, and Root Access is not responsible for missing or tampered items.

**Respect Others:** Do not tamper with or access any locker that isn't yours.

## Additional Info

**Locker rentals are billed monthly**, regardless of whether your membership is monthly or annual. This allows for flexibility — you can cancel your rental or switch to a different locker at any time without being locked into a long-term commitment.

**Please do not alter or damage lockers.** This includes drilling or painting. Stickers and other non-permanent decorations are fine. Members may be billed for repairs or replacement if a locker is damaged beyond normal wear and tear. If you're unsure whether a modification is okay (e.g. adhesives, magnetic hooks, etc.), ask us first.

**Lockers are first-come first-served.** They are limited and not guaranteed to be available at all times.

## When You're Done

Here's what you need to know if you cancel your locker rental:

**No Refunds:** We don't issue refunds for partially used months. You’ll continue to have access through the end of your paid period, even after canceling, unless you ask us to clear the locker early.

**Clean It Out:** You must empty your locker and remove your lock by the end of your current billing cycle.

**Abandoned Lockers:** Lockers left full after cancellation may be cleared by staff. Your lock may be cut if needed.

**Unclaimed Items:** If we clear your locker, we may hold the contents for up to 30 days. After that, items may be donated, repurposed, or discarded at staff discretion. If you think you've left something behind, contact us as soon as possible. We make reasonable efforts to return personal items but cannot guarantee recovery.

### Fees

- **Locker Clearing Fee:** $10 — if staff have to empty your locker after cancellation.
- **Lock Cutting Fee:** $10 — if staff have to cut your lock to reclaim the locker.
