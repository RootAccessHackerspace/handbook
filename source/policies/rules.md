General Rules
=============

## 0. Don't be the reason for making a new rule.

Follow the rules and safety guidelines we have, use common sense, and don't be the reason we have to make a new rule. _Assume that every other rule on this list has an implicit "See also: Rule 0." appended to it._

## 1. Be excellent to each other.

The "Don't be a jerk" rule. For more information, including expected behavior, anti-harrassment policy, and details on reporting conduct violations, see the {doc}`/policies/conduct`.

## 2. Safety rules are written in blood. Avoid blood.

Follow our {doc}`/safety/guidelines` and {doc}`/safety/tools` at all times, and encourage others to do the same.

## 3. Don't do anything illegal.

Root Access does not condone any illegal activities. Don't break the law in the space, using the space's equipment, or with something you built at the space. We're not a space for [black hats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hat_(computer_security)); at most, our hats are lighter shades of gray.

## 4. Tools are for members.

Some tools at Root Access are dangerous, expensive, fragile, or some combination of the three. As such, only members may generally use the tools and equipment at the hackerspace.

Members are expected to know the risks of the tools they're using and to not use anything they haven't been trained on. Additionally use of all such equipment is at the members own risk and they agree not to hold Root Access or any other members, instructors, directors or officers liable for injury or damage caused by using such equipment.

Members must also make every effort to ensure tools are not damaged in their use. They also understand that if they break something they may be responsible for the cost of replacement or repair.

## 5. Pay your dues.

Root Access exists because of memberships; if members don't pay their dues, we don't exist. Membership dues are expected to be paid in full, on time, each month. If you're having trouble or need an extension, let us know and we can work something out.

## 6. You must abide.

Members agree to abide by the rules and guidelines set forth by this handbook. We try to be a respectful group of grown-ups because every rule means more administrative overhead for our leadership and volunteers. More overhead means less time to be makers. Less time to be makers makes us cranky.

---

Repeated or flagrant violations of these rules may result in consequences including fines, temporary suspension of membersip, or permanent expulsion from the hackerspace.
