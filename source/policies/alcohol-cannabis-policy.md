# Alcohol & Cannabis Policy

## Overview

Root Access is first and foremost a community hackerspace and makerspace, and we want to preserve the creative, collaborative culture that makes this place great. Alcohol and cannabis can have a place here, but must be used in a way that supports, not disrupts, that mission.

To that end, we allow the responsible use of alcohol and cannabis on-site, provided that such use complies with California law and Root Access policies, including (but not limited to) the {doc}`/safety/guidelines` and {doc}`/policies/conduct`.

_**tl;dr — Enjoy Responsibly.** That's the rule. The rest of this policy explains how we support that expectation and keep the space safe for everyone._

## Legal & Age Restrictions

### Age Restrictions

- **21+ Only:** You must be 21 years of age or older to consume alcohol *or* cannabis at Root Access. No exceptions.
- **No Providing to Minors:** Providing alcohol or cannabis to anyone under 21 is illegal and grounds for immediate removal from the space and possible suspension or termination of membership.

### Legal Compliance

- **Alcohol:**  Drinking is permitted in accordance with California law. BYOB is permitted, but intoxication that affects others or the space will not be tolerated.
- **Cannabis:** Use is permitted in accordance with California law. BYOW is permitted, but use that affects others or the space will not be tolerated.
- **Equipment Use:** Our {doc}`/safety/guidelines` prohibit using tools or machinery while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. If you're impaired, don't operate equipment.
- **Open Containers:** Once opened, alcoholic beverages must remain on the premises. Do not leave the building or walk into public areas (like the sidewalk) with an open container, as this may violate California open container laws.
- **Indoor Smoking & Vaping:** Smoking or vaping cannabis (or anything else) is **not allowed indoors** under state workplace and clean air laws. If you choose to use cannabis outside, be discreet and respectful of others.

## Enjoy Responsibly

### What That Means

Having a few drinks or a cannabis product in a mellow, social setting is fine. Getting so intoxicated or impaired that you become disruptive, aggressive, unsafe, or make others uncomfortable is not.

Alcohol and cannabis are never an excuse for poor judgment, damaged equipment, unsafe practices, or disrespect toward others.

### Enforcement Actions

Root Access aims to handle issues with care and fairness. Consequences for misuse of alcohol or cannabis are based on the nature and severity of the situation.

- **Immediate Action: (Keyholder / Event Organizer Discretion)**
  Keyholders may ask someone to stop drinking or using cannabis if it appears to be affecting their behavior, safety, or respect for others. They may also ask someone to leave the space for the rest of the day. These decisions are not personal and are made to protect the community when issues arise. Keyholder decisions are final and should be respected in the moment.

- **Cooling-Off Period (Informal Break):**
  In some cases, a member may be asked by Root Access leadership to take a break from the space for a few days or even a couple of weeks. This is not a punishment—it's a preventative step to reset expectations and help maintain a positive environment.

- **Formal Disciplinary Action (Board Review):**
  Serious or repeated violations, such as aggressive behavior, unsafe conduct, or bringing illegal substances into the space, may result in temporary or permanent suspension of membership. These decisions are made by the Board and follow our {doc}`/policies/conduct` enforcement process.

## Alcohol in the Space

### BYOB Policy

Root Access allows the consumption, informal sharing, and storage of member-provided alcohol, including use of the community refrigerator and kegerator. This is considered a form of BYOB and must follow these clear boundaries:

- All use must remain **low-key, non-commercial**, and **restricted to individuals 21 and over**.
- **Alcohol use in the space is a revokable privilege** and should never be treated as a perk of membership or event attendance.
- **Label anything that's not meant to be shared** by putting your name on it. Unlabeled alcohol may be assumed to be shared—**when in doubt, ask first**.
- Root Access is **not responsible** for any personal alcohol stored on-site.

### Beer Made Here: Homebrewing at the Hackerspace

Some members occasionally brew beer at Root Access as part of a shared hobby and learning experience. Homebrewing is legal under California law when done for personal or community use, and not sold or distributed publicly.

- Homebrew made at Root Access must be for **personal or community consumption only**, and never sold or exchanged for money.
- It may be **shared informally among adults 21+**, but should not be served at public events or used to promote attendance.
- Brewing activities must remain **safe, clean, and respectful of the shared space and equipment**.

We love that members are building skills and exploring creative projects like brewing. Just remember, the same expectations apply—keep it mellow, legal, and respectful of others.

## Safety & Accountability

### Safe Transportation

If you've been drinking or using cannabis, don't drive. Plan ahead, use a rideshare, or ask for help. Look out for one another—we're a community.

We trust our members to be thoughtful, respectful, and look out for one another. This policy exists to support that trust and to keep Root Access safe, legal, and welcoming for everyone.

### Reporting Concerns

- If someone's behavior crosses a line, please follow the reporting guidelines in the {doc}`/policies/conduct`.
- If someone appears too impaired to be safe or respectful, let a keyholder know right away.
