# Root Access Policy Handbook

```bash
user@hackerspace:~$ man rootaccess
```

## Welcome to the hackerspace!

We're thrilled to have you join our community! Our mission is to provide education and practical experience in all sorts of making and promote the same in the community. We aim to provide a hackerspace that serves all experience levels from beginners to hobbyists to experienced professionals.

Our goal is to help you develop your skills and give you a space and tools to express them, while building a community that fosters a culture of inclusiveness and collaboration.

As part of our community, we want to make it easy to know what we're about, what resources are available to you, what you should expect from the community, and what the community expects from you. This handbook has a lot of information in it. You really should read it. If you have questions, feel free to ask Root Access leadership - we are happy to discuss all of this. If something is missing, let us know that too.

Again, welcome to Root Access! We can't wait to see what you make and how you help our community prosper.

## The Basics

Root Access is a community that runs a hackerspace. You buy a monthly membership to gain access to the skill and expertise of the members, the shared space, and all the tools therein. You learn to safely use the tools provided and then use them to make things. You only use the tools you have been trained on to ensure the safety of everyone. We're sort of like a gym for nerds.

This handbook describes policies and procedures that keep the hackerspace humming along. The core of this is simply safety and sharing. We want the members to be safe and to share what we have in a way that is equitable and sustainable.

### Check the Wiki

тоб [rootaccess.org/wiki](https://rootaccess.org/wiki/)

The wiki is our collective knowledgebase for what's at Root Access and how to use it, along with other ancillary information about the space. It is about fabrication and making and a bit of hacking, and covers tools, techniques, materials, safety, settings, and sources.

If you ever have a question about something in the space or how to do something, checking the wiki should be your first step.
