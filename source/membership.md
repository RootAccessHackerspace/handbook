# Membership

## FAQs

### What do I get for being a member?

* Access to an amazing community of talanted folks.
* Access to Root Access facilities and tools during our regular hours (and often outside of them).
* Discounts on classes and workshops.
* Available for adults aged 18 and up.

### I'm a member, when can I come by?

Our public hours are posted on our website, and members are always welcome to come use the space during those times. If you'd like to come by outside of those hours, it is best to check Discord to see if a keyholder is present and able to let you in. (Eventually, we would love to have a 24-hour access system for members.)

## Membership Levels

### Regular

_Monthly: $59, Annual: $649_

Regular members have access to the space any time we are open (and often when we are not), and may use any of our tools (assuming any necessary safety training has been completed).

### Discounted

_Monthly: $29, Annual: $319_

The same benefits and access as the regular membership, but with a reduced price. This membership level is intentionally open-ended, but is generally for students, teachers, veterans, folks with disabilities (including invisible disabilities), and immediate family of existing regular or discounted members. We use the honor system here, and assume that anyone on the discounted membership has a valid reason – please don't abuse this. _(See {doc}`/policies/rules`, Rule #0.)_

### Casual / Supporting

_Monthly: $19_

The easiest way to support Root Access! This is generally for folks who need limited access to the space, attend our public community events, or who just want to help support the space. Use of tools is limited, basically restricted to hand tools. If you want to use the laser cutter, 3D printers, soldering irons, sewing machines, table saw, or any other specialty tools or equipment, you should be a full member.

## Becoming a Member

Membership is open to anyone age 18 and over, and the process for joining is simple:

3. That's it!

Once you have signed up for a membership and completed the necessary forms, you are now a member of the hackerspace and you may use our facilities within the boundaries set by this handbook.

Welcome to the club!

## Cancelling Your Membership

While it makes us sad to see folks leave, we totally get it. Cancelling membership can be done by signing into rootaccess.org and navigating to the membership page under your account. We do not give refunds or credits for unused membership time – you remain a member, with full membership rights, until your current billing cycle ends, and we will not charge you again until or unless you renew your membership.

We do not have the ability to "pause" memberships. If you wish to pause your membership for any reason, we recommend that you cancel your membership and renew it when you'd like to resume.
