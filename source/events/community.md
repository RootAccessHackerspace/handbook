# Community Events and Meetups

We host a number of community events and meetups at the hackerspace. Some of these events happen regularly, while others are one-off. Some are directly organized by Root Access, and others are organized by other groups or members of the community.

Anyone may organize a meetup, and we do not charge to host meetups that are free and open to the public.

Some community events and meetups we regularly host include:

[ArtHop](https://www.fresnoartscouncil.org/programs/arthop)
    : A monthly arts event, held on the first Thursday of each month in the Tower District and Downtown Fresno.

[Fresno Python](https://fresnopython.com/)
    : A monthly meetup for folks who use (or want to learn) the Python programming language.

Sip 'n' Stitch
    : A monthly crafting social meetup, where folks hang out and work on knitting, crochet, or embroidery projects.

...any many more that are [listed on our calendar](https://rootaccess.org/calendar/).

## Groups and Clubs

In fostering a community, it's natural to bring together groups of members to meet, share and gain feedback on their making or on some aspect of Root Access itself, such as a shop area, on a short or long-term basis.

Any members interested in starting a new meetup should get in touch with Root Access leadership.
