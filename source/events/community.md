Community Events and Meetups
============================

We host a number of community events and meetups at the hackerspace. Some of these events happen regularly, while others are one-off. Some are organized by the space itself, and others are organized by members of the community.

Anyone may organize a meetup, and we do not charge to host meetups that are free and open to the public.

Some community events and meetups we regularly host include:

[ArtHop](https://www.fresnoartscouncil.org/programs/arthop)
    : A monthly arts event, held on the first Thursday of each month in the Tower District and Downtown Fresno.

Groups and Clubs
----------------

In fostering a community, it's natural to bring together groups of members to meet, share and gain feedback on their making or on some aspect of Root Access itself, such as a shop area, on a short or long-term basis.

Any members interested in starting a new meetup should get in touch with Root Access leadership.
