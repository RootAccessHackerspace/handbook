========

Root Access takes a serious approach to COVID-19 safety. The following rules are in place to ensure our community can safely gather and work on their projects.

🤒 | DO NOT come to Root Access if you have a temperature, any COVID-19 symptoms, or if you have been in contact with anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 14 days.

🕓 | We're back to our regular hours on weekends only, which means Friday/Saturday 12pm-9pm and Sunday 12pm-7pm.

🎟️ | Open hours are for members only. No public meetups or non-member groups on these days. If you'd like to check out the space, please get in touch and we'll schedule a tour during off-hours.

💉 | You must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, unless there is a valid age, religious, or medical exemption.

😷 | You must wear a mask when inside Root Access. Masks may be removed when outdoors.

↔️ | Please observe social distancing guidelines, and try to stay 6-feet from others.

We appreciate your cooperation and patience as we try to navigate a phased reopening in a manner that keeps everyone safe.
